You are entering the special realm of the Quantum Hype World.

Before explainning you a bit more about it, would like to say special thanks to
all the teachers and tutors from the Quantum Games 2022 Spring course, as well as the students
and team number 10, for all the patience and kindness.

Quantum Rock Paper Scissor:

The game is a version of the traditional and most well known for being the most fair and fun way 
of solving disputes among friends and enemies, Rock Paper Scissors.

You are a young physicist that met a horrible robot who is planning to destroy the whole Quantum Games
discord server. Challenged by him to a QRPS match, your task is to strategically choose the best quantum
hype definition.

HOW TO PLAY:

Players use the mouse to select which Quantum Weapon he wants to use against the computer, and such will 
pick one also randomly. The game will follow the traditional Rock Paper Scissor logic, where one symbol 
destroys exactly one other and gets beat by also one other.
